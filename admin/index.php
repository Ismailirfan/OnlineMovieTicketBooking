    <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
    <p>
    The Administrative Dashboard provides administrators direct access to important Encompass tools
     for faster and more convenient community management.
    </p>
    <p>The Dashboard serves as an administrative home page with access
         to key components of your community. The Dashboard not only offers
          an “at a glance” look at your events, donation campaigns, and e-mails,
          adding a campaign, adding photos, adding members, and more. In addition, you’ll receive 
           but also serves as a launching point for frequent actions including creating an e-mail,
            important announcements from Encompass and have your institution’s
         personal Encompass contact information all in one location.</p>
         <p class="my-5">Based on individual administrative rights, modules can be added from the Add Modules bar. Additionally,
             modules can be deleted from the layout (when deleted, the module returns to the Add Modules 
             bar and can be added again at any time).
             The administrator can move the modules to any preferred layout arrangement.</p>
